title: Two papers accepted to ESA 2015
---

The ESA 2015 conference has accepted two papers from our group:

*Fast Output-Sensitive Matrix Multiplication* by Riko Jacob and Morten Stöckel 
This paper proposes an output sensitive Monte Carlo algorithm for sparse matrix multiplication.

*I/O-efficient Similarity Join in High Dimensions* by Rasmus Pagh, Ninh Pham, Francesco Silvestri, Morten Stöckel.
The work is on I/O-efficient algorithms for computing similarity joins based on locality-sensitive hashing (LSH).

ESA 2015 is the 23rd European Symposium on Algorithms and will be held Patras, Greece on September 14-16.
