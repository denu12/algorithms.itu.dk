<p>Abstract: This paper studies the ε-approximate range emptiness problem, where the task is to represent a set \(S\) of \(n\) points from \(\{0, \ldots , U − 1\}\)
and answer emptiness queries of the form “\([a; b] \cap S\neq \emptyset ?\)”
 with a probability of false positives allowed. This generalizes the functionality of Bloom filters from single point queries to any interval length \(L\).
Setting the false positive rate to \(\epsilon /L\) and performing \(L\) queries, Bloom filters yield a solution to this problem with space \(O(n \log(L/\epsilon))\) bits, false positive probability bounded by \(\epsilon \) for intervals of length up to \(L\), using query time \(O(L \log(L/\epsilon))\). Our first contribution is to show that the space/error trade-off cannot be improved asymptotically: Any data structure for answering approximate range emptiness queries on intervals of length up to L with false positive probability \(\epsilon\), must use space \(\Omega(n \log(L/\epsilon))−O(n)\) bits. On the positive side we show that the query time can be improved greatly, to constant time, while matching our space lower bound up to a lower order additive term. This result is achieved through a succinct data structure for (non-approximate 1d) range emptiness/reporting queries, which may be of independent interest.</p>
