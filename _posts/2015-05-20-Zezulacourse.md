In the Information Society, information holds the master key to economic influence. This intensive PhD course focuses on efficient ways to locate user-relevant information in collections of objects, the similarity of which is quantified using a pairwise distance measure, as a direct response to recent advances in computing, communications and storage which have led to the current flood of digital libraries, data warehouses and the limitless heterogeneity of internet resources. We introduce state-of-the-art index structures for searching complex data modeled as instances of a metric space.
 
Based on the following book: http://www.nmis.isti.cnr.it/amato/similarity-search-book/

Participation in this course is free of charge, but seating is limited to 20 people. If you wish to participate or have any questions please contact Johan Sivertsen at jovt@itu.dk.
